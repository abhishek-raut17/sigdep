# Overview

**SigDep** (codename: **ED-TEMS**) is a distributed, event-driven task and event management system designed for developers who prioritize scalability, modularity, and system-level control.

At its core, SigDep leverages a **microservices-based architecture**, emphasizing **Availability** and **Partition Tolerance (AP)** under the CAP theorem, with eventual consistency. Its loosely coupled services communicate via REST and asynchronous message brokers (e.g., Kafka), ensuring reliability, fault tolerance, and horizontal scalability.
